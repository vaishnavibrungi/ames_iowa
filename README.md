# **Problem Statement**

At our real estate investment firm, apart from providing investors with new and refurbished investment properties, we also do consultation service to sellers who want to sell their homes by estimating sale price, finding buyers, taking care of the documentation process until the seller handovers key to the buyer. We have been given a list of clients who are willing to sell their homes in Ames city in  Iowa. This analysis seeks to predict the sale price of homes in Ames. This analysis also aims to list down top factors that affect sale price in Ames which can be used as a checklist in the future if any client from these locations approaches us seeking consultation service to sell their property.

# **Conclusions**

The objective of the analysis was to build a model to predict housing prices of different residences in Ames, IA. Our best model resulted in an RMSE of 26109.34, which translates to an error of  ~Â±$26109 for the average-priced house.
The factors seen as most important or as strongest predictors through our model were :
   * Overall House Quality
   * Living Area Square footage
   * Basement Square Footage
   * Garage Square Footage
   * Garage Car Capacity(i.e. number of cars garage can accommodate)
   * Number of Fireplaces
   * Year Built(i.e. The more recent is the house built, the higher is the sale price)
   * Total Number of Bathrooms
   * Area of Exterior Masonry
